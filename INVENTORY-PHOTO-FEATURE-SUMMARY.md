# Inventory Photo Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added photo upload functionality to the inventory management system with Supabase Storage integration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema
- Added `photo_url` column to `inventory_items` table in Supabase
- Updated `scripts/03-create-inventory-table.sql` to document the new column

### 2. Type Definitions
- Updated `InventoryItem` interface in `lib/types.ts` to include `photo_url?: string`

### 3. Data Store Updates
- Updated `loadInventoryFromSupabase()` to map the `photo_url` field
- Updated `addItem()` to include `photo_url` in insert operations
- Updated `updateItem()` to include `photo_url` in update operations
- Updated `deleteItem()` to identify items with photos for deletion

### 4. Photo Storage Utilities
- Created `lib/photo-storage.ts` with:
  - `uploadInventoryPhoto()` - Upload images to Supabase Storage
  - `deleteInventoryPhoto()` - Delete images from Supabase Storage
  - `setupInventoryPhotosBucket()` - Setup function for bucket

### 5. UI Updates in Inventory View
- Added photo upload field to add/edit form with validation
- Added image preview for uploaded photos
- Added progress indicator during upload
- Added photo display in inventory cards
- Added photo deletion when items are deleted
- Updated form submission to handle photo upload operations

### 6. Security & Validation
- File type validation (images only)
- File size validation (5MB limit)
- Automatic cleanup of old photos when updating items

## Current Issue
- Getting "Auth session missing!" error when trying to upload photos
- Operations are happening without proper authentication
- Error suggests session isn't being properly propagated from auth context

## Required Setup
1. Create Supabase Storage bucket named `inventory-photos` (public)
2. Ensure environment variables are properly set
3. Verify authentication context is available during operations
