-   Added error handling with console logging

### 2. `components/user-management.tsx` (Admin)

-   Made `handlePasswordReset()` async
-   Added success/failure feedback with alerts
-   Made password setting on user creation async with `await`

### 3. `components/change-password.tsx` (User Self-Service)

-   Updated to use async `setUserPassword()`
-   Added success/failure handling
-   Password changes now persist to database

## Features

-   ✅ All password changes persist to Supabase database
-   ✅ Password hash properly stored using existing hash function
-   ✅ Success/failure feedback to users

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Admin Reset Password

1. Login as admin: `adminarsa@clientname.com` / `password`
2. Go to Users management
3. Click "Reset Password" on any user
4. Enter new password or click "Generate Password"
5. Click "Reset Password"
6. Reload page and try logging in with new password ✅

### Test 2: Manager Reset Password

1. Create a manager user in a department
2. Login as manager
3. Go to "Department Users"
4. Click "Reset Password" on a user in your department
5. Generate and save new password
6. Logout and login with that user's new password ✅

### Test 3: User Change Password

1. Login as any user
2. Go to user profile/settings (if change password component is rendered)
3. Enter current password and new password
4. Submit
5. Logout and login with new password ✅

## Database Schema

Password is stored in `users` table:

-   Column: `password_hash` (VARCHAR)
-   Hash algorithm: Simple hash from `lib/password-utils.ts`
-   Hash example: `4889ba9b` for password "password"

## Important Notes

-   Password hash uses simple algorithm (not production-ready)
-   For production, replace with bcrypt or Argon2
-   All password changes are logged in audit logs
-   Supabase credentials must be valid in `.env.local`
-   Falls back gracefully on Supabase errors

## Files Modified

1. `lib/data-store.ts`
2. `components/user-management.tsx`
3. `components/change-password.tsx`
4. `components/department-user-management.tsx`

All changes are backward compatible and handle errors gracefully.
